## Mission
Your mission is to comb through outer space. Recently a large shipment of biscuits went missing in a nearby asteroid belt. Adventure through outerspace and recover space biscuits. Watch out for debris like asteroids while searching.

## Controls
**W** - Fires the rocket booster and propels your spacecraft through space\
**A & D** - fires the left and right booster to change the direction of your craft


## Goal for project
My goal for this project was to create my first game to participate in a game jam in. Phaser allows me to build on Web development by using javascript to create the games. I can then deploy these games easily on my personal websites as well as a hosting medium like itch.io. I wanted to learn fundementals about scenes and how to get started with developing larger games by trying to implement good archetecture.

## What I have learned.
I have grown my interest in programming significantly just simply by working on things that truely interest me. I learned that reading docs is not as difficult as is once seemed, and that watching people start their own projects on youtube as well as talking to Ai (in order to understand topics like passing information to different scenes and updating registry. At no time was any code copy pasted from Ai, it was solely used to grasp new topics and answering questions I still had from reading docs) I learned how basic archetecture of games looks and have a solid grasp for initializing a new project. I have a solid foundation of how player manipulation works as well as phsyics overlap and collision between objects. I had to step into a new area of game creation to create sprites, splashscreens, and the game board background.

## For the future
I wish to implement shooting mechanics to destroy asteroids as well as
An enemy(s) that will hunt the player based on how many biscuits they have aquired.
I want to learn animation using aseprite to animate the rocket booster whenever we decide to use it
I finally want to learn how to make music and play sound effects in my games.
